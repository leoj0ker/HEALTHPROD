<p class="vsit"> Begin on all fours (hands and knees) with your hands on the floor directly underneath your shoulders about shoulder-width distance apart. Lift up off of your knees by completely extending your legs behind you. Tuck your toes under so that your entire body is lifted up off the ground, supported by your arms and legs. This his high plank position and one variation of the plank exercise. To do a forearm plank (slightly more challenging), simply lower down onto your forearms, slowly and with one arm at a time. Be sure to keep your shoulders above your elbows. You can angle your forearms inward or keep them straight. Anytime you are in a plank position (forearm or high) be sure to focus on keeping your core engaged. Do not let your hips drop or push your rear up into the air. You want to keep your spine in alignment and aim to keep a mostly straight line from your head to your toes. Let your gaze fall just in front of your in order to make sure that your neck stays in alignment with your spine; do not tuck your chin towards your chest or lift your neck up. </p><br>
